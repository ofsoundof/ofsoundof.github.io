Two papers on biosignal foundation models are accepted to EMBC 2025!
One paper introduces [FEMBA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11168), a state-space model for efficient and scalable EEG analysis.
The other paper develops a model for blood pressure estimation with [ECG and PPG signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17460).
