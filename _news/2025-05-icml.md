Two papers on model quantization are accepted to [ICML 2025](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2025)!
[IntLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21759) proposes an integral low-rank adaption method for quantized diffusion models.
After low-rank adaptation, all the weights are converted to integers.
[SliM-LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14917) proposes a mixed precision quantization method for LLMs.
