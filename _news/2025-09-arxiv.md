One work on joint quantization and sparsification is released on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11177). 
In this work, we propose an error compensation method to reconcile the conflicting requirements of quantization and pruning.
The proposed method delivers up to **4.72x** speedup and **6.4x** memory reduction compared to the FP16-dense baseline.
